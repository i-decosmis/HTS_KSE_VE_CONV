## Download üì•
You can [download](https://github.com/i-decosmis/HTS_KSE_VE_CONV/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the zip file or clone the repository.
* Extract the folder from the downloaded zip.
* The folders containing the images and the compressed PSD file are `Poker Size` and `Tarot Size`.
* The `Open Sans and Patua One` folder contains fonts needed to open the PSD project; everything is explained below.

## Video Tutorial üé•
I've uploaded a video tutorial that explains the steps for translating a card: [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSjCtiTquEM)

## What's Included üßê
* **PNG files** for each expansion (KSE, VE, CONV), divided by language (Italian and English).
* **PSD files** for both poker- and tarot-sized cards, prepared with the Make Playing Cards (MPC) template.
* **Editable Monster and Party Leader cards** without names, so you can add translations using the provided PSD files.
* A **complete Italian translation** for all cards.

## File Organization üìå
The files are organized into two main folders:
* **Poker Size**
* **Tarot Size**

Each folder contains both PSD *comp and PNG files, organized by card type and including card backs.

### PNG Organization üñºÔ∏è
All PNG files are ready for upload to the [Make Playing Cards](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/) site, with details as follows:
* [Poker Size: 63 x 88mm](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/design/custom-blank-card.html)
* [Tarot Size](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/design/design-your-own-tarot-cards.html)

Cards are organized by category (e.g., `Challenges`) and then by language and expansion. Each expansion includes two versions:

* **With Label**: Custom labels created to distinguish cards by category, like:<br />
  <img src="../../Poker Size\Heroes\ENG\KSE\With Label\Renovern.png" alt="Logo" width="350">

* **Without Label**: Standard cards without custom labels, for example:<br />
  <img src="../../Poker Size\Heroes\ENG\KSE\Without Label\Renovern.png" alt="Logo" width="350">

> Note: For `The Rhythmic Archer` card, I chose to keep the original label intact, so this card appears with a label in all versions.

## PSD File Details üì∏
**REQUIREMENTS**:
* Install the fonts found in the `Open Sans and Patua One` folder. For `Open Sans`, I recommend installing the two ttf files in the `Open_Sans` folder and ignoring the `static` folder.

Unzip the PSD file you want to work on from the 7z archive, then open it.

In the Photoshop files, each expansion is organized by category (e.g., `Challenges`) and labeled by expansion (e.g., `KSE`). For each **card folder** in the PSD file, you‚Äôll find the following layers:
* **KSE/VE/CONV Layer**: A label layer created for each expansion. (For the card `Sorcerer Challenge`, the label was slightly adjusted to avoid covering the card name).
* **ITA Layer**: The final image in Italian.
* **ITA Folder**: Contains the Italian names and descriptions positioned on each card. **You can use these as a template for translating to other languages**.
* **Hide Layer**: Hides the English text from the base card image.
* **No Name Layer (for Monsters and Party Leaders only)**: A version of the card with the name removed.
* **English Layer**: The base card in English.

## Results üìä
**Settings that I have used to print cards on the MakePlayingCards site**:
* Card Stock: M29 (from this¬†post).
* Print Type: Full Color Print.
* Finish: MPC card finish (from this¬†post).
* Other options up to your preference.

I just received the cards I ordered from the MakePlayingCards site, and I‚Äôve included photos below.

Compared to the original, the edges of the card's corners display a larger curvature radius, making the corners less sharp and more rounded.

Here is the thing I‚Äôd consider changing:
* Instead of using M29, I think an M30 or M31 finish would provide a texture more similar to the original cards.

The margins for the Party Leaders' card back have been fixed in the repository, ensuring that the prints will have the same margins as the originals

The colors of the various images are vibrant, and the print quality is precise, so the overall result is pretty good.

For the slight color difference on the back: if your group includes particularly competitive players, and someone needs to draw a card from another player, you can stack the cards on top of each other and have them choose by asking for a number. This prevents anyone from exploiting the color difference to select a specific card.

## FAQ ‚ùì
**Q: Why did you only move the label on the `Sorcerer Challenge` card and not on all the other cards to keep them consistent?**

A: I prefer the label to stay at that precise, consistent height across all cards, because I like it. For most cards, this position works perfectly without obscuring important details. However, on the `Sorcerer Challenge` card, the label would cover part of the name, so I adjusted the height slightly for this card only to ensure the name remains visible.

**Q: What settings should I use to print cards on the [Make Playing Cards](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/) website?**

A: I've used the following settings:
* Card Stock: M29 (from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HereToSlay/comments/w7u6fc/does_anyone_know_what_type_of_cardstock_the_cards/)).
* Print Type: Full Color Print.
* Finish: MPC card finish (from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpcproxies/comments/rycpki/mpc_card_stock_options_a_review/)).
* Other options up to your preference.

I suggest:
* Instead of using M29, I think an M30 or M31 finish would provide a texture more similar to the original cards.
